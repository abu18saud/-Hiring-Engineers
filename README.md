# -Hiring-Engineers
We are hiring programmers on our team. There are 10 candidates, and we need to choose 3 of them. In the program you are given, you have 10 candidates in a hash set. You need to take 3 names as input, add them to a new hiring hash set and check if they are present in our candidates set. If they are, the program should output "Starting hiring process", otherwise, "Something is wrong".
